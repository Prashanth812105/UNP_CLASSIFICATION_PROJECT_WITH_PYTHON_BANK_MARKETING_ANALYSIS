# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_BANK_MARKETING_ANALYSIS


This project aims to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit using demographic, financial, and campaign-related data. The dataset includes features such as age, job, education, account balance, previous campaign contacts, and outcomes of past interactions. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, treating outliers, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the dataset for machine learning. Multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, were applied to capture patterns in customer behavior and identify the most effective predictive approach. The analysis highlighted key factors influencing subscription decisions, such as age, balance, prior contact outcomes, and campaign duration. These insights can help banks optimize marketing campaigns, focus on high-potential customers, and improve overall targeting efficiency.
Overall, the project demonstrates how data-driven strategies can enhance customer engagement and marketing effectiveness.
